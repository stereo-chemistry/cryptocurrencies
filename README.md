# cryptocurrencies
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to report on cryptocurrencies to an investment bank. We are interested in which cryptocurrencies are currently traded and classifying those cryptocurrencies with unsupervised machine learning techniques. In order to ensure the quality of our report, we want to determine the best number of clusters (cryptocurrency classifications) for our algorithm's output with three principal components to visualize in 3 dimensions.
## Description
First, a .csv file containing our data was preprocessed; dropping untraded cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies with null data values, cryptocurrencies with coins mined less than or equal to zero, and string values converted with .get_dummies(). The resulted dataset was scaled with sklearn's StandardScaler, and reduced to three principal components with sklearn's PCA. To determine the best number of clusters for our cryptocurrency classification, an elbow curve was drawn with sklearn's KMeans. A KMeans model was then fit with 4 clusters. The KMeans model's predictions were added to a new DataFrame along with the principal component values and other relevant data. The three principal components were added to axes and plotted against a 3d scatter plot by classification with plotly.express. The total coin supply and total coins mined were scaled to a range of 0 to 1 with sklearn's MinMaxScaler() and plotted against each other by classification with hvplot.scatter.
